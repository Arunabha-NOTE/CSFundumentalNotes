# Fancy Words

1. **Idempotent**  
   Run multiple times without changing the results.

2. **Ephemeral**  
   Lasting only a day (can be modified or lost; can't go back to the original).

3. **Immutable** *(Bonus Word)*  
   Unable to be changed.

4. **Anonymous**  
   Functions that don't have a name.

5. **Predicate**  
   Something declared (e.g., "is" is added in front of function names; similar to types in TypeScript).

6. **Memoization**  
   Cache the return value of a function.

7. **Abstraction**  
   Drawn from. Hiding implementation details from the end user.

8. **Serialization**  
   In order. Usually used to convert something into a common language, for example, `JSON.stringify()`.
